# randogram

This is a simple test harness which allows you to produce "randogram" graphs for simple (max 32-bit state) PRNGs. It was inspired by Chris Wellons' [blog post](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/11/17/) about QBasic's PRNG.

Randograms allow you to visually assess the quality of a PRNG.
